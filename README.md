# Oberon-07
Some modules I wrote in or ported to [Niklaus Wirth](https://inf.ethz.ch/personal/wirth/)'s Oberon-07 programming language.

If a module is dependent on imports that are unique to Project Oberon 2013 ('Oberon V5')
this is indicated by a *context comment* after the module name (*&nbsp;IN&nbsp;V5&nbsp;\*); if it also works on
earlier versions of Oberon System then this is indicated with (\*&nbsp;IN&nbsp;Oberon&nbsp;\*).
